# Iterating Your Book with StoryCraftr 📖🔄

Writing a book is an iterative process. **StoryCraftr** not only helps you generate the initial structure and content, but it also enables you to **refine** and **enhance** your book over time. Whether you need to tweak character names, motivations, or adjust the structure of your chapters, StoryCraftr has you covered.

## Automatic Refinement

Every command in StoryCraftr automatically refines the content of an existing file. If a file already exists, the new content generated by StoryCraftr will **refine**, **update**, or **add to** the existing content without overwriting it entirely.

For example, if you've already generated a chapter synopsis and run the command again, it will **refine the existing synopsis**, making it more detailed or adjusting it based on new input.

## Iterative Commands

### 1. Check and Fix Character Names

Over time, as you develop your story, you might want to check for consistency in character names. This command will **scan all chapters** for character names and either fix inconsistencies or make recommendations.

```bash
storycraftr iterate check-names "Check character names for consistency."
```

To update or fix a character name across the entire book:

```bash
storycraftr iterate fix-name Zevid Rhaedin
```

### 2. Refine Character Motivation

Characters need strong motivations, and sometimes these evolve as you write. This command will **refine character motivations** throughout the book, ensuring consistency and depth.

```bash
storycraftr iterate refine-motivation "Rahedin" "Refine its motivations in a story about rebellion against gods."
```

### 3. Strengthen Story Argument

The core argument or theme of your story can sometimes become diluted. This command will **reiterate and strengthen the argument or theme** across the book to ensure it is clear and compelling.

```bash
storycraftr iterate strengthen-argument "Ensure the argument of rebellion against divine control is clear."
```

### 4. Insert Chapters and Adjust Numbering

Sometimes, you may need to insert a chapter between two existing ones. This command will **insert a new chapter** and automatically **adjust the numbering** of all subsequent chapters.

```bash
storycraftr iterate insert-chapter 2 "Insert a new chapter that explores a critical event from the protagonist’s past, shedding light on their true intentions and setting the stage for the conflict in chapter 1."
```

### 5. Split a Chapter

If a chapter becomes too long or covers too many topics, you can **split it into two separate chapters**. This command will split the specified chapter and adjust the numbering of all subsequent chapters.

```bash
storycraftr iterate split-chapter 3 "Split chapter into two chapters."
```

### 6. Add Flashbacks

Flashbacks are a great way to add depth to a character’s backstory. This command lets you **add a flashback scene** between two chapters, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the surrounding narrative.

```bash
storycraftr iterate add-flashback 3 "Insert a flashback revealing a hidden alliance the protagonist formed years ago, explaining a key turning point in the current events."
```

### 7. Update Plot Points

Plot points are critical to maintaining tension and momentum in your story. Use this command to **update or refine key plot points** across the story, making sure they align with the latest developments in the book.

```bash
storycraftr iterate update-plot-points "Refine the plot points around the rebellion’s climax."
```

### 8. Consistency Check Across All Files

Before completing your book, it's important to check for consistency across all files. This command will **review the entire structure** to ensure character arcs, motivations, plot points, and even worldbuilding elements are aligned.

```bash
storycraftr iterate check-consistency "Ensure consistency of character arcs and motivations throughout the story."
```

## Iterating Efficiently

The power of **StoryCraftr** lies in its ability to help you **iterate** without losing track of the overall structure. By running these commands after each major drafting session, you ensure that your book evolves into a cohesive and polished narrative.

The iterative process in **StoryCraftr** aligns with the principles outlined by **Brandon Sanderson** in his approach to writing. Sanderson emphasizes the importance of consistency, depth, and thematic clarity—principles that StoryCraftr can help you apply throughout your story development.

## Running Iterations in the Background

Need to keep chatting while a heavy `!iterate` command runs? Use a sub-agent:

```bash
:sub-agent !iterate editor check-consistency "Audit the revenge subplot"
```

- Roles live under `.storycraftr/subagents/` and each lists the commands it is allowed to execute.
- Use `:sub-agent !status` to watch progress and `:sub-agent !logs editor` to open the markdown transcript of the run.
- Regenerate or localize the role definitions at any time with `storycraftr sub-agents seed --language <code> [--force]`.
